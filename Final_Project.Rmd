#### Part 1: Simulation Exercise
1. Overview
In this project we are investigating the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. We are investigating distribution of averages for 40 expenonentials.
2. Simulations
Taking 1000 averages of 40 random exponentials with lambda=0.2. Putting averages in mns.
```{r}
mns<-NULL
for (i in 1:1000) {
        mns=c(mns,mean(rexp(40,0.2)))
}
```
3. Sample Mean vs Theoretical Mean
4. Sample Variance vs Theoretical Variance
5. Distribution



#### Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis
1. Loading Data & Basic Analysis
2. Data Summary
3. Comparing Tooth Growth by supp & dose
4. Assumptions & Conclusions
